## Overview

This was a great project which is fairly simple and involves only HTML and CSS.  Nonetheless, the CSS required some work and proved to be a great learning experience.

## My process

1. I began by initializing my project as a public repository on [GitHub](https://github.com/rtoddm/e_learning_page).
2. Then I configured my repository to publish my code to a web address (GitHub pages).
3. I looked through the designs in order to plan how I'd tackle the project. This step is important to help you think through potential CSS classes to create reusable styles.
4. However, before worrying about any styles, I structured my HTML content.
5. I then wrote out the basic styles for my project such as `font-family` and `font-size`, etc.
6. Then I started adding CSS styles to the top of the page and worked down.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This project really helped me to better understand and further hone my CSS.  It pushed me to better understand Flexbox, the "position" property, and z-index. 

### Continued development

Moving forward I plan on completing a responsive project utilizing HTML and CSS along with JavaScript.
